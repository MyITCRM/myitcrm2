## Create a New User

To create a New user, You simply fill in all the relevant information for the new user.

Ensure that you select the correct permission for the new user.

Here you can select if the new user:

* Is a Client/Customer? => Options Yes or No

    This will limit this users permissions to only sections that the user has permission too.
These are define under the `Business Settings/Roles` section where you can assign permission to the role selected.*

* Is the User an Employee? => Options Yes or No.

    If the user is an employee, this allows for an addition level of security.*

* Can this user be assigned Work Orders?  => Options Yes or No.

    Not all users will be able to be assigned work orders. For example, an accountant or receptionist may never be assigned a work order.
This removes this user from the list of users who can be assigned to work orders.*

* Role  => Defaults are Super User, Technician, Client.

    Here you can assign the particular role to this user. By default all new users who sign up through the frontend registration section
automatically are assigned a client role. You can also add a customer role by going to `Business Settings/Roles`
(you need to be a super user to create/edit roles and there permissions.)
